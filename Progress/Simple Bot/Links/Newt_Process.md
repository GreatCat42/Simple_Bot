## Simple & Brutal Newt: The Core of this Program

```
The "Stupid & Brutal Newt"
Process:
	1- Select two Event IDs
	2- Mark one as the "Cause" and the other as the "Effect"
	3- Within a time interval after "Cause" takes place, find out the Average Frequency of "Effect" taking place, mark it as F1
	4- Within the time span of the WHOLE SIMULATION, find out the Average Frequency of "Effect" taking place, mark it as F2
	5- Calculate the number F1/F2, mark as A, Evaluate.
	6
		A >> 1 -- the "Cause" is actually causing "Effect"
		A is close to 1 -- the "Cause" has nearly nothing to do with "Effect"
		A << 1 -- the "Cause" is actually repressing "Effect"
```
